Porter is a data import abstraction library to import any data from anywhere. To achieve this she must be able to generalize about the structure of data. Porter believes all data sets are either a single record or repeating collection of records with consistent structure, where *record* is either a list or tree of name and value pairs.

Porter must be able to abstract data importing requirements so that she can import any type of data, in a similar way that a database must be able to abstract data storage requirements such that it can store any type of data. To be clear, Porter is only interested in data import, not storage. To facilitate this Porter's interfaces use arrays, also known as *records* and array iterators, also known as *record collections*. Arrays are useful because we can store any data type as values and iterators are useful because we can iterate over an unlimited number of records, thus allowing Porter to theoretically import any data format of any size.

The [Provider][Provider] organization hosts projects that use Porter to provide useful data. These repositories are ready-to-use Porter providers that grant access to popular third-party APIs and data services. Check it out before writing a new provider to see if it has already been written! Anyone writing new providers is encouraged to contribute them to the organization.

Usage
-----

Porter's `import` method accepts an `ImportSpecification` that describes which data should be imported and how the data should be transformed. To import `MyResource` we might write the following.

```php
$records = $porter->import(new ImportSpecification(new MyResource));
```

Provider resources, such as `MyResource`, specify the `Provider` class name they work with. Imports will only work when a resource's provider has been added to Porter, otherwise `ProviderNotFoundException` is thrown. To find which provider `MyResource` requires we examine its `getProviderClassName` method, which returns `MyProvider::class`, in this case. In the following example we register `MyProvider` with Porter.

```php
$porter = (new Porter)->registerProvider(new MyProvider);
```

Calling `import()` returns an instance of `PorterRecords`, which implements `Iterator`, allowing us to enumerate each record in the collection using `foreach` as in the following example.

```php
foreach ($records as $record) {
    // Insert breakpoint or var_dump() here to examine each $record.
}
```

Import specifications
---------------------

Import specifications specify *what* to import, and optionally, *how* it should be transformed thereafter and whether to use caching. The only mandatory parameter, passed to the constructor, is a `ProviderResource` that specifies the data we want to import.

Options may be configured by the setters listed below.

 - `setFilter(callable)` &ndash; Specifies a predicate that may remove records; see [filtering](#filtering) for more.
 - `setMapping(Mapping)` &ndash; Specifies a mapping to transform each record; see [mapping](#mapping) for more.
 - `setContext(mixed)` &ndash; Specifies user-defined data to be passed to Mapper and filters.
 - `setCacheAdvice(CacheAdvice)` &ndash; Specifies a caching strategy; see [caching](#caching) for more.

The order of operations is fixed and occur in the following order.

 1. Fetch records from `ProviderResource`.
 2. Filtering.
 3. Mapping.

Since the order is fixed, it is not currently possible to exclude records based on data that only exists after mapping.

Record collections
------------------

The result of a successful `Porter::import` call is an instance of `PorterRecords` or one of its specialisations. All collection types returned by Porter extend `RecordCollection`, which implements `Iterator`, and guarantees the collection is enumerable using `foreach`.

Record collections are composed by Porter using the decorator pattern. If provider data is not modified, `PorterRecords` will decorate the `ProviderRecords` returned from a `ProviderResource`. That is, `PorterRecords` has a pointer back to the previous collection, which could be written as: `PorterRecords` → `ProviderRecords`. If a mapping was applied, the collection stack would be `PorterRecords` → `MappedRecords` → `ProviderRecords`. In general this is an unimportant detail for most users but it can be useful for debugging. The stack of record collection types informs us of the transformations a collection has undergone and each type holds a pointer to relevant objects that participated in the transformation, for example, `PorterRecords` holds a reference to the `ImportSpecification` that was used to create it and can be accessed using `PorterRecords::getSpecification`.

A collection may be `Countable`, depending on whether the imported data set was countable and whether any destructive operations were performed after import. Filtering is a destructive operation since it may remove records and therefore the count reported by a `ProviderResource` may no longer be accurate. It is the prerogative of the imported resource to supply the number of records in its collection by returning `CountableProviderRecords` which causes Porter to return `CountablePorterRecords` as long as no destructive operations were performed. This is possible because all non-destructive collection types have a `Countable` analogue.

Filtering
---------

Filtering provides a way to remove some of the records. For each record, if the specified predicate function returns false or another falsy value the record will be removed, otherwise the record will be kept. The predicate receives the current record as an array as its first parameter and context as its second parameter.

In general we would like to avoid filtering because it is inefficient to import data and then immediately remove some of it, but some immature APIs do not provide a way to reduce the data set on the server, so filtering on the client is our only option. Filtering also invalidates the record count reported by some resources, meaning we no longer know how many records are in the collection before iteration.

#### Example

The following example filters out any records that do not have an *id* field present.

```php
$records = $porter->import(
    (new ImportSpecification(new MyResource))
        ->setFilter(function (array $record) {
            return isset($record['id']);
        })
);
```

Mapping
-------

Porter integrates [Mapper][Mapper] to support data transformations using `Mapping` objects. A full discussion of Mapper is beyond the scope of this document but the linked repository contains comprehensive documentation. Porter builds on Mapper by providing a powerful mapping strategy called `SubImport`.

### Sub-imports

Porter's `SubImport` strategy provides a way to join data sets together. A mapping may contain any number of sub-imports, each of which may receive a different `ImportSpecification`. A sub-import causes Porter to begin a new import operation and thus supports all import options without limitation, including importing from different providers and applying a separate mapping to each sub-import.

#### Signature

```php
SubImport(ImportSpecification|callable $specificationOrCallback)
```

 1. `$specificationOrCallback` &ndash; Either an `ImportSpecification` instance or `callable` that returns such an instance.

#### ImportSpecification Example

The following example imports `MyImportSpecification` and copies the *foo* field from the input data into the output mapping. Next it performs a sub-import using `MyDetailsSpecification` and stores the result in the *details* key of the output mapping.

```php
$records = $porter->import(
    (new MyImportSpecification)
        ->setMapping(new AnonymousMapping([
            'foo' => new Copy('foo'),
            'details' => new SubImport(MyDetailsSpecification),
        ]))
);
```

#### Callback example

The following example is the same as the previous except `MyDetailsSpecification` now requires an identifier that is copied from *details_id* present in the input data. This is only possible using a callback since we cannot inject strategies inside specifications.

```php
$records = $porter->import(
    (new MyImportSpecification)
        ->setMapping(new AnonymousMapping([
            'foo' => new Copy('foo'),
            'details' => new SubImport(
                function (array $record) {
                    return new MyDetailsSpecification($record['details_id']);
                }
            ),
        ]))
);
```

Caching
-------

Caching is available at the connector level if the connector implements `CacheToggle`. Connectors typically extend `CachingConnector` which implements [PSR-6][PSR-6]-compatible caching. Porter ships with just one cache implementation, `MemoryCache`, which stores data in memory but this can be substituted for any PSR-6 cache if the connector permits it.

When available, the connector caches raw responses for each unique cache key which is comprised of source and options parameters. Options are sorted before the cache key is created so the order of options is unimportant.

Caching behaviour is specified by one of the `CacheAdvice` enumeration constants listed below.

* `SHOULD_CACHE` &ndash; Response should be cached if a cache is available.
* `SHOULD_NOT_CACHE` &ndash; Response should not be cached even if a cache is available.
* `MUST_CACHE` &ndash; Response must be cached otherwise an exception may be thrown.
* `MUST_NOT_CACHE` &ndash; Response must not be cached otherwise an exception may be thrown.

The default cache advice is `SHOULD_NOT_CACHE`, meaning connectors supporting caching will not cache responses and connectors not supporting caching will not throw any exceptions.

#### Example

The follow example enables connector-level response caching, if available.

```php
$records = $porter->import(
    (new ImportSpecification(new MyResource))
        ->setCacheAdvice(CacheAdvice:SHOULD_CACHE())
);
```

Architecture
------------

Porter talks to *providers* to fetch data. Providers represent one or more *resources* from which data can be fetched. Providers pass a *connector* needed by their resources to fetch data. Resources define the provider they are compatible with and receive the provider's connector when fetching data. Resources must transform their data into one or more *records*, collectively known as *record collections*, which present data sets as an enumeration of array values.

The following UML class diagram shows a partial architectural overview illustrating Porter's main components.

[![Class diagram][Class diagram]][Class diagram]

Providers
---------

Providers fetch data from their `ProviderResource` objects by supplying them with a valid `Connector`. A provider implements `Provider` that defines one method with the following signature.

```php
public function fetch(ProviderResource $resource) : Iterator;
```

When `fetch()` is called it is passed the resource from which data must be fetched. The provider must supply the resource with its connector which it typically does by calling `$resource->fetch($connector)`.

A provider knows whether a given resource belongs to it by calling `ProviderResource::getProviderClassName()` and checking for equality, but a provider does not know how many resources it has nor maintains a list of such resources and neither does any other part of the application. That is, a resource class can be created at any time and claim to belong to a given provider without any formal registration, and the provider must accept all such objects.

### Writing a provider

Note: before writing a provider be sure to check out the [Provider organization][Provider] to see if it has already been written!

Providers must implement the `Provider` interface, however it is common to extend `AbstractProvider` instead. The abstract class provides a `fetch()` implementation, stores a connector and proxies cache methods for the connector. A typical `AbstractProvider` implementation only needs to override the constructor with a more specific type hint for the connector type it requires. Providers may also store state applicable to their resources, such as authentication data, and passed to resources when `fetch()` is called.

#### Implementation example

In the following example we create a provider that only accepts `HttpConnector` instances. We also create a default connector in case one is not supplied. Note it is not always possible to create a default connector and it is perfectly valid to insist the caller supplies a connector.

```php
final class MyProvider extends AbstractProvider
{
    public function __construct(HttpConnector $connector = null)
    {
        parent::__construct($connector ?: new HttpConnector);
    }
}
```

Resources
---------

Resources fetch data using the supplied connector and format it as a collection of arrays. A resource implements `ProviderResource` that defines the following three methods.

```php
public function getProviderClassName() : string;
public function getProviderTag() : string;
public function fetch(Connector $connector, EncapsulatedOptions $options = null) : Iterator;
```

A resource supplies the class name of the provider it expects a connector from when `getProviderClassName()` is called. A used-defined tag can be specified to identify a particular Provider instance when `getProviderTag()` is called.

When `fetch()` is called it is passed the connector from which data must be fetched. The resource must ensure data is formatted as an iterator of array values whilst remaining as true to the original format as possible; that is, we must avoid renaming or restructuring data because it is the caller's prerogative to perform data customization if desired.

Providers may also supply options to `fetch()`. Such options are typically used to convey API keys or other options common to all of a provider's resources. When specified, a resource must ensure the options are transmitted to the connector.

### Writing a resource

Resources must implement the `ProviderResource` interface, however it is common to extend `AbstractResource` instead because it provides a working implementation for provider tagging. A typical `AbstractResource` implementation implements `getProviderClassName()` with a hard-coded provider class name and a valid `fetch()` implementation.

It is important to understand `fetch()` must always return an iterator of array values. Suppose we want to return the numeric series one to three. The following implementation would be invalid because it returns an iterator of integer values instead of an iterator of array values.

```php
public function fetch(Connector $connector)
{
    return new ArrayIterator(range(1, 3)); // Invalid return type.
}
```

Either of the following examples would be valid `fetch()` implementations.

```php
public function fetch(Connector $connector)
{
    foreach (range(1, 3) as $number) {
        yield [$number];
    }
}
```

Since the total number of records is known, the iterator can be wrapped in `CountableProviderRecords` to enrich the caller with this information.

```php
public function fetch(Connector $connector)
{
    $series = function ($limit) {
        foreach (range(1, $limit) as $number) {
            yield [$number];
        }
    }

    return new CountableProviderRecords($series($count = 3), $count, $this);
}
```

#### Implementation example

In the following example we create a resource that receives a connector from `MyProvider` and uses it to retrieve data from a hard-coded URL. We expect the data to be JSON encoded so we decode it into an array and use `yield` to return it as a single-item iterator.

```php
class MyResource extends AbstractResource
{
    const URL = 'https://example.com';

    public function getProviderClassName()
    {
        return MyProvider::class;
    }

    public function fetch(Connector $connector)
    {
        $data = $connector->fetch(self::URL);

        yield json_decode($data, true);
    }
}
```

Connectors
----------

Connectors fetch remote data from the specified source. A connector implements `Connector` that defines one method with the following signature.

```php
public function fetch(string $source, EncapsulatedOptions $options = null);
```

When `fetch()` is called the connector fetches data from the specified source whilst applying any options that may have been specified. If a connector accepts options it must define its own options class and ensure its type is passed. Connectors may return data in any format that's convenient for resources to consume, but in general, such data should be as raw as possible and without modification.

### List of connectors

The following connectors are provided with Porter.

 - `HttpConnector` &ndash; Fetches data from an HTTP server via the PHP wrapper.
 - `SoapConnector` &ndash; Fetches data from a SOAP service.

Requirements
------------

 - [PHP 5.5](http://php.net/)
 - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

Limitations
-----------

 - Filtering always occurs before mapping.
 - Imports must complete synchronously. That is, calls to `import()` are blocking.
 - Sub-imports must complete synchronously. That is, the previous sub-import must finish before the next starts.

Testing
-------

Porter is almost fully unit tested. Run the tests with `bin/test` from a shell.
